# Rawu Visuals Portfolio

This is the portfolio website for Rawu Visuals.

## Local Development

To serve the site locally with clean URLs, run:

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser.

The site uses clean URLs (e.g., /hvem instead of /hvem.html), which work both locally and on GitHub Pages.
